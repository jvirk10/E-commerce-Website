# E-commerce-Website

E-commerce-website
Description
This app is the backend portion of an E-Commerce website. Express.js was used for the server and MySQL for the database along with Sequelize as the ORM to run SQL models and queries. The SQL database includes tables for products, categories, tags, and product tags. RESTful API routes are used to make requests and updates from the database which are joined through Sequelize queries.

Technologies Used
Javascript
Node.js
Sequelize
MySQL2
Express
Dotenv



Installation

Install Node.js and mySQL2

Install dependencies

npm init --y
npm install express sequelize mysql
Initiate mySQL shell using the command 'mysql -u root -p'.

Create the schema from the MySQL shell using 'source db/schema.sql' and then 'USE ecommerce_db' and then quit

After creating the models and routes, run 'npm run seed' to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

To start running application simply input 'npm start' or 'node server.js'

Usage
Youâ€™ll need to use the MySQL2 (Links to an external site.) and Sequelize (Links to an external site.) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the dotenv package (Links to an external site.) to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Test
This application is test on Insomnia.
